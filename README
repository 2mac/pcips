pcips
=====

Portable C IPS patch utility. This program implements the IPS patching format,
including such functions as applying patches to binaries, generating new patch
files from modified binaries, and joining multiple patch files together in
order.

Most of you finding this program know what you're doing, but for those
unfamiliar with the format, I have described it in an included [text file][1].

Build
-----

You'll need an ANSI C compiler and a POSIX build environment. On Debian-based
systems, you can get this with:

    # apt install build-essential

pcips uses a simple build process:

    $ make

Install
-------

After building, you can install the program with

    # make install

Usage
-----

To apply a patch:

    $ pcips -a patch_file source_file output_file

If you want to patch the source file in place (overwriting it):

    $ pcips -ia patch_file source_file

To create a patch file based on an original and a modified file:

    $ pcips -c patch_file source_file modified_file

To join (concatenate) multiple patch files into a single file that will apply
them in the same order:

    $ pcips -j output_file input1 [input2 ...]
